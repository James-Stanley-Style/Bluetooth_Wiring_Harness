# Bluetooth_Wiring_Harness
A Bluetooth Wiring Harness for a Porsche 924S that uses a Raspberry Pi 4B as a Hub and a series of Raspberry Pi Zero W / W 2's as peripheral units. 
This project was completed for MAE 586 - Project Work In Engineering in the pursuit of my Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering from NCSU.
This project was completed under the advisement of Dr. Cheryl Xu, NCSU Faculty Professor.
It was used to demonstrate a prototype for embedded bluetooth systems in a high stress enviornment like a car engine bay.
